  #### Getting Started
  [Vesta](http://vestacp.com/) is an open source, web based control panel for
  managing Linux servers.

  #### Accessing Your Deployment
  To access your Vesta deployment, go to https://<Vesta Server IP>:8083 in your
  browser. Login with the admin username and password provided.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using
  [chef-solo](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html). Once the deployment is
  up, chef will not run again, so it is safe to modify configurations.
